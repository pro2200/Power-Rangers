The app will also be available to clients in self-serve form at hotels to use with comfort where there are no clerks.  If there are               people to behind the desk, the Hotel front desk clerks can make room reservations, provide information and services to guests and receive payment for         services till the end of the visit with the application. Users may be able to use the app on their computer or tablet. We will use an ERD model to show       what will be needed from the end users to correctly use the app. Once the form is completed, the information will be transferred to a MSSQL database.
